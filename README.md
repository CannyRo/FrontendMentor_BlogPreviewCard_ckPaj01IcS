## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

I learned and tried to use the BEM methodology for my Css.  I also learned how to modify a child's Css when hovering over the parent.
And I'm still proud because this is the third challenge I've submitted.

### Continued development

I need to keep practicing to improve my execution speed and reduce the time needed to complete a challenge.
